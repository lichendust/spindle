/*
	To be clear, I hate this.

	Unfortunately, there isn't a _great_ way of letting users
	define their own inline syntaxes and then have the
	parser figure those out â€” it would require that the
	parser inform the parser of how the parser should work
	mid-stream which... is possible, of course, but it's so
	far beyond my capabilities as a programmer that I
	haven't managed to even begin to reason about how to
	architect something that could work that way.

	I did make a (never checked-in) earnest attempt at *italics*
	and **bold**-style definitions, which are based on
	balanced sets of known characters, and therefore quite
	easy to specify (pseudo-syntax, I never did work out an
	idiomatic style):

		[**]:begin = <b>
		[**]:end   = </b>

	Unfortunately, this falls down immediately because it's not
	sufficient for specifying something like this:

		1. [some link](https://website.com)
		2. some mapping syntax?
		3. <a href="%2">%1<a>

	To do this, I'd need a secondary definition layer (step 2)
	and this is where my point in the opening statement
	comes from: the parser would have to be made of aware of
	the how the stream is assembled _while parsing_ and
	context-switch in and out of it by scope.

	Rather than letting this kill the project, I've decided to
	just ship _something_ that works, and as distasteful as
	this is amid the true parser that handles everything else,
	I really only have the choice of either hard-coding
	inline syntaxes or letting users configure them
	external to the program text.
